# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This is a requirement analysis for a booking management software developement. It is done to have an efficient and actionable blueprint for the software and safe resuourses in the process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do by gathering, studying, and organizing the needs of users and stakeholders. It involves identifying functional and non-functional requirements and ensuring they are clear, complete, and agreed upon.
### üß† Why It's Important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is a critical first step in the SDLC because it sets the foundation for all future development. A well-analyzed requirement:

* Helps developers build the right product
* Reduces misunderstandings and rework
* Saves time and cost in later stages
* Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholders expectations


## ‚ùì Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process starts on the right foot and          leads to a product that meets real user needs. Here are three key reasons why it‚Äôs critical:

* ### ‚úÖ Clarity and Shared Understanding
  It ensures all stakeholders‚Äîdevelopers, designers, clients, and users‚Äîhave a clear and common understanding of what the software should do. This reduces confusion and        sets expectations early.

* ### üí∏ Reduces Cost and Rework
  Identifying requirements early helps catch gaps, inconsistencies, or unrealistic expectations before development begins. Fixing issues at this stage is far cheaper           than making changes during or after development.

* ### üéØ Guides the Development Process
  Requirements serve as a roadmap for developers, testers, and project managers. They help in planning, designing, and building the software in a structured and goal-          oriented manner.

## üß© Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that help ensure the software solution is well-defined, understood, and aligned with stakeholder expectations. Here are the five core activities:

* ### üîç Requirement Gathering
  Collecting raw information and needs from stakeholders, end-users, and domain experts. This forms the initial input for further analysis.

* ### üó£Ô∏è Requirement Elicitation
  Actively engaging with stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming, or observation to dig deeper and uncover hidden or implicit needs.

* ### üìù Requirement Documentation
  Clearly writing down all gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format (like user stories or use cases) to ensure they're understandable and trackable.

* ### üìä Requirement Analysis and Modeling
  Examining and organizing the documented requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, and gaps. Visual models like diagrams may be used to simplify complex requirements.

* ### ‚úÖ Requirement Validation
  Reviewing and confirming that all documented requirements are correct, complete, realistic, and aligned with business goals. This is typically done with stakeholders         before development begins.


## üßæ Types of Requirements
Understanding the different types of requirements is crucial for the successful development of a hotel booking management system. Requirements are generally categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional.

### üîß Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of the system. They describe what the system should do.

Examples for a Hotel Booking Management System:

* ### User Registration and Authentication:
  Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.

* ### Search Functionality:
  Enable users to search for hotels based on location, availability, and price range.

* ### Booking Management:
  Allow users to book rooms, view booking history, and cancel reservations.

* ### Payment Processing:
  Integrate with payment gateways to handle transactions securely.

* ### Admin Dashboard:
  Provide administrators with tools to manage listings, view bookings, and generate reports.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes of the system. They define how the system performs a function.

Examples for a Hotel Booking Management System:

* ### Performance:
  The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

* ### Scalability:
  The architecture should support scaling to accommodate increasing numbers of users and data.

* ### Security:
  Implement SSL encryption for data transmission and store passwords using hashing algorithms.

* ### Usability:
  Design an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate for both customers and administrators.

* ### Availability:
  Ensure the system is available 99.9% of the time, with minimal downtime.


## üéØ Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users (called actors) and the system. It shows the various actions (called use cases) that users can perform within the system. These diagrams help to:

Clarify system functionality from the user's perspective

Identify different user roles and what each role can do

Serve as a bridge between requirement analysis and system design

### üßæ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
* Simplifies communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders

* Helps identify system scope and boundaries

* Ensures clarity in understanding who does what in the system

* Improves documentation and planning for developers and testers

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
### What is Acceptance Criteria?
Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must meet in order to be considered complete and ready for release. They are a set of specific, clear, and testable requirements that define the expected behavior of a feature or user story. Acceptance Criteria are typically written from the user's perspective and are used to guide the development process, ensuring that the system functions as intended.

### Why is Acceptance Criteria Important in Requirement Analysis?
Acceptance Criteria are a critical part of Requirement Analysis for several reasons:

* ### Ensures Alignment with Stakeholder Expectations:
  By defining clear criteria, it becomes easier to verify that the feature meets the needs and expectations of the users and stakeholders.

* ### Guides the Development Process:
  Acceptance Criteria help developers understand what needs to be done and provide them with a clear benchmark for success.

* ### Improves Testing:
  Clear acceptance criteria provide testers with a set of conditions to check against during the testing phase. This ensures that the feature is thoroughly tested and works   as expected.

* ### Prevents Scope Creep:
  By defining exactly what is included in a feature, acceptance criteria help prevent unnecessary features from being added, keeping the development focused and on track.

### Example of Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System:
  Feature: Checkout Process for Hotel Booking

### Acceptance Criteria:

* ### User Authentication:
  The user must be logged in before proceeding with the checkout.
  If not logged in, the system will prompt the user to log in or register.

* ### Room Selection:
  The user can view available rooms for the selected dates.
  The user can select a room type and quantity.

* ### Pricing Calculation:
  The system must display the total cost of the booking, including any applicable taxes, fees, and discounts.
  The user must be able to see a breakdown of the cost (e.g., price per night, number of nights, total amount).

* ### Payment Integration:
  The user must be able to enter payment details securely through an integrated payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
  The payment system must handle multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards and online wallets.

* ### Confirmation and Receipt:
  After successful payment, the system must provide a booking confirmation with booking details.
  The user should receive an email with booking confirmation and a receipt containing booking reference, hotel information, and payment details.

* ### Booking History:
  The booking must appear in the user's booking history, accessible through their account profile.
  
* ### Error Handling:
  If the payment fails, the user must receive an error message explaining the issue and be prompted to try again.
  If a room is no longer available during checkout, the user must be informed and given the option to select a different room or date.
