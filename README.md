# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This is a requirement analysis for a booking management software developement. It is done to have an efficient and actionable blueprint for the software and safe resuourses in the process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do by gathering, studying, and organizing the needs of users and stakeholders. It involves identifying functional and non-functional requirements and ensuring they are clear, complete, and agreed upon.
### 🧠 Why It's Important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is a critical first step in the SDLC because it sets the foundation for all future development. A well-analyzed requirement:

* Helps developers build the right product
* Reduces misunderstandings and rework
* Saves time and cost in later stages
* Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholders expectations


## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process starts on the right foot and          leads to a product that meets real user needs. Here are three key reasons why it’s critical:

* ### ✅ Clarity and Shared Understanding
  It ensures all stakeholders—developers, designers, clients, and users—have a clear and common understanding of what the software should do. This reduces confusion and        sets expectations early.

* ### 💸 Reduces Cost and Rework
  Identifying requirements early helps catch gaps, inconsistencies, or unrealistic expectations before development begins. Fixing issues at this stage is far cheaper           than making changes during or after development.

* ### 🎯 Guides the Development Process
  Requirements serve as a roadmap for developers, testers, and project managers. They help in planning, designing, and building the software in a structured and goal-          oriented manner.

## 🧩 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that help ensure the software solution is well-defined, understood, and aligned with stakeholder expectations. Here are the five core activities:

* ### 🔍 Requirement Gathering
  Collecting raw information and needs from stakeholders, end-users, and domain experts. This forms the initial input for further analysis.

* ### 🗣️ Requirement Elicitation
  Actively engaging with stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming, or observation to dig deeper and uncover hidden or implicit needs.

* ### 📝 Requirement Documentation
  Clearly writing down all gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format (like user stories or use cases) to ensure they're understandable and trackable.

* ### 📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling
  Examining and organizing the documented requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, and gaps. Visual models like diagrams may be used to simplify complex requirements.

* ### ✅ Requirement Validation
  Reviewing and confirming that all documented requirements are correct, complete, realistic, and aligned with business goals. This is typically done with stakeholders         before development begins.


## 🧾 Types of Requirements
Understanding the different types of requirements is crucial for the successful development of a hotel booking management system. Requirements are generally categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional.

### 🔧 Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of the system. They describe what the system should do.

Examples for a Hotel Booking Management System:

* ### User Registration and Authentication:
  Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.

* ### Search Functionality:
  Enable users to search for hotels based on location, availability, and price range.

* ### Booking Management:
  Allow users to book rooms, view booking history, and cancel reservations.

* ### Payment Processing:
  Integrate with payment gateways to handle transactions securely.

* ### Admin Dashboard:
  Provide administrators with tools to manage listings, view bookings, and generate reports.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes of the system. They define how the system performs a function.

Examples for a Hotel Booking Management System:

* ### Performance:
  The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

* ### Scalability:
  The architecture should support scaling to accommodate increasing numbers of users and data.

* ### Security:
  Implement SSL encryption for data transmission and store passwords using hashing algorithms.

* ### Usability:
  Design an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate for both customers and administrators.

* ### Availability:
  Ensure the system is available 99.9% of the time, with minimal downtime.
