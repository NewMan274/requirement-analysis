# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This is a requirement analysis for a booking management software developement. It is done to have an efficient and actionable blueprint for the software and safe resuourses in the process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do by gathering, studying, and organizing the needs of users and stakeholders. It involves identifying functional and non-functional requirements and ensuring they are clear, complete, and agreed upon.
### 🧠 Why It's Important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is a critical first step in the SDLC because it sets the foundation for all future development. A well-analyzed requirement:

* Helps developers build the right product
* Reduces misunderstandings and rework
* Saves time and cost in later stages
* Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholders expectations

## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process starts on the right foot and          leads to a product that meets real user needs. Here are three key reasons why it’s critical:

* ### ✅ Clarity and Shared Understanding
It ensures all stakeholders—developers, designers, clients, and users—have a clear and common understanding of what the software should do. This reduces confusion and        sets expectations early.

* ### 💸 Reduces Cost and Rework
Identifying requirements early helps catch gaps, inconsistencies, or unrealistic expectations before development begins. Fixing issues at this stage is far cheaper           than making changes during or after development.

* ### 🎯 Guides the Development Process
  Requirements serve as a roadmap for developers, testers, and project managers. They help in planning, designing, and building the software in a structured and goal-          oriented manner.
